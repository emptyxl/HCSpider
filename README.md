### HCSpider
A generic spider for security testing. The built-in spiders in common scanning tools crawl all the links to the HTML file. This may seem like a very comprehensive way, but it is incomplete and inefficient for security testing. Many web pages use js or ajax to dynamically generate page content. The urls in these content cannot be obtained through some library like requests. In addition, the content of many pages is generated by the frameworks. For example, the display of merchandise, the playing page of video, etc., except for the content, the logic is exactly the same. For security testing, we don't need to crawl and test those same pages.

Our spider use `selenium` + `headless chrome` to simulate a real browser environment and parse url in both static and dynamic content. We use the bloom filter and the url path similarity to clean the duplicate content.
